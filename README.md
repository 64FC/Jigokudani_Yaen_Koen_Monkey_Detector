# Jigokudani Yaen Koen Monkey Detector

The aim is to build a "monkey detector" for the [Jigokudani Monkey Park](https://en.jigokudani-yaenkoen.co.jp/).

Around the middle of the webpage there should be two links:
- One for streaming,
- The other one for still images (although labelled **Live Camera**), one per hour during opening time (*to be verified for Summer season*)
  - 9am - 4pm Japan Standard Time Winter Season (November - March),
  - 8.30am - 5pm Japan Standard Time Summer Season (April - October).

We'll use the latter for now (to be updated).
